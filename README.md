# termux-ubuntu

To install, just curl the link and execute with bash: (installs 20.04 by default)
```
curl -sLO htts://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikl-ls/termux-ubuntu/master/ubuntu.sh
bash ubuntu.sh 
```
There are two flags in this script:

- `-v` to specify the version, just like my Termux-Debian script
- `-u` to uninstall

Made this script when I heard that Ubuntu 20.04 was released
